# SMBGhost
Simple scanner for CVE-2020-0796 - SMBv3 RCE.

The scanner is meant only for testing whether a server is vulnerable. It is not meant for research or development, hence the fixed payload. 

It checks for SMB dialect 3.1.1 and compression capability through a negotiate request.

A network dump of the scanner running against a Windows 2019 Server (10.0.0.133) can be found under `SMBGhost.pcap`. 

## Usage
`python3 scanner.py <IP>`
